Don't worry, Nikel API isn't going anywhere.

However, maintaining an API requires lots of work, so we are looking for maintainers for the various Nikel projects.

* [nikel-core](https://github.com/nikel-api/nikel): Written in Go. Serves the API.
  * [nikel-cache](https://github.com/nikel-api/nikel-cache): Cache middleware for nikel-core.
* [nikel-parser](https://github.com/nikel-api/nikel-parser): Written in Python. Parses data sources and generates datasets.
* [nikel-ts](https://github.com/nikel-api/nikel-ts): Written in Typescript. The official Node.js API wrapper for Nikel.
* [nikel-docs](https://github.com/nikel-api/nikel-docs): Written in Javascript + Markdown. Nikel API's documentation.

If anyone is interested in working on a web app written in Vue: [nikel-app](https://github.com/nikel-api/nikel-app). Here is a [working demo](https://nikel-api.github.io/nikel-app/).
