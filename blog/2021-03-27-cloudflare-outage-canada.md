Users in Canada might have troubles accessing Nikel API. This is most likely due to an unacknowledged issue with Cloudflare.

If you have any questions regarding this outage, please contact Nikel API at [api@nikel.ml](mailto:api@nikel.ml).

Thank you.

:::note Update

Update: The issue seems to be fixed, but there is still no acknowledgement from Cloudflare that the issue occurred.
