### What is Nikel API?

Nikel (pronunciation: `/'ni:k…õl/`) is a collection of data APIs for the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). It's aimed to be a viable replacement for the now unmaintained and non-functioning [Cobalt API](https://cobalt.qas.im/).

Nikel API is built with performance in mind with request caching and low latency querying. The Nikel Core is written in 100% [Go](https://golang.org/) using the [Gin Web Framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) for reliability and speed.

As a result, **Nikel API will always be free and unlimited**.

### Why?

A crucial part of applications are APIs. The Nikel API is aimed to assist students and developers in providing high quality data APIs on the University of Toronto.

### Contributing

[Nikel is opensource](https://github.com/nikel-api). If you want to contribute, pull requests are always welcome. Any help is greatly appreciated.

### Next Steps

Here's a list of things Nikel will hopefully accomplish in the future:

* Add more endpoints
* Deploy Nikel Core on a proper VPS
