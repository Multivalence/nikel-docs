It has been a while since there was an update.

Nikel's growth is starting to slow down. This isn't a bad thing! It means that users are starting to stabilize. I hope that this period of stability will allow developers to become familiar with the API. The API is only a month old now, so it'll take a little while for people to gain trust of Nikel.

Stay tuned for more updates...
