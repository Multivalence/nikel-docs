### What happened?

Around 10 EDT, there was a [faulty commit](https://github.com/nikel-api/nikel/commit/a07a0927d252cef3d0991486a71537bea15c2e87) that happened to pass continuous integration.

This caused the API to return empty responses for about 10 hours and 30 minutes to 8:30 EDT.

A fix is released and the issue is resolved.

Sorry for any inconveniences caused,

Daren Liang
