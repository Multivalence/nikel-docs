**This API is still currently in development. Some endpoints may change and the API is still yet to be versioned.**

**If something breaks, please check the documentation for any recent breaking changes.**

Although the API is free, there are very lenient rate limits posed to prevent API abuse.

The current rate limit is **20 requests per second on uncached requests**.
