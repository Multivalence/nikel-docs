Nikel (pronunciation: `/'ni:k…õl/`) is a collection of data APIs on information about the University of Toronto.

:::note Important

**This API is still currently in development. Some endpoints may change.**

**If something breaks, please check the documentation for any recent breaking changes or contact [api@nikel.ml](mailto:api@nikel.ml).**

Although the API is free, there are very lenient rate limits posed to prevent API abuse.

The current rate limit is **20 requests per second for uncached requests**. Cached requests are not subjected to ratelimits.
